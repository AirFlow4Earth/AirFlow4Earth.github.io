<h1>Slogan</h1>
<h3>Lessening health risk from Point A to Point B</h3>

<h1>Mission</h1>
<h3>We know that technology can help people to adapt with changing air conditions.</h3>
<p>We are a start-up with the goal of mitigating health risks associated with health pollution. By combining data sets, we integrate known relationships from research journals to advise our users on reasonable routes to avoid unnecessary exposure to pollution. Our AI improves health based decision making.</p>
</section>
<section id="features">
<h1>Features</h1> 
<p>Gaps exist within the current market that address air quality route decision making. Current service providers are often stuck selling sensors to augment poor quality data sets and provide instructions that cover a city or a large area that lacks relevance to users. We are able to use our insights gained from literature reviews and awareness of the current state of technology to reach a 10 m” per 15 minute resolution of route guidance, possibly better, to make possible reasonable guidance for every travel and exercise.</p>

<section id="details">
<h1>Details</h1>
<p><i>Importance</i> As climate change is expected to intensify, the effects of air pollution will affect lifestyles differently. The complexity of the relationships will effect different people in different ways; meaning that what is better for heart patient is not the same as an runner seeking an optimal performance during a training or a match. For automotive manufacturers slight shifts in navigation might reduce costs of maintain the expensive air filtration systems in vehicles. Our AI helps to reduce the adverse impacts of preventable travel through.</p>

<h1>Our Solutions</h1>
<div class="flex-container">

<div><h2>Influencing climate adaptive behaviors</h2>
<p>Individuals with health conditions affected by pollution can lead healthier lives with slight changes to the routes that they walk, run, or exercise.</p>

<div>
<h2>Improving sports performance</h2>
<p>Athletes and health conscious people can have increased control over the routes that they choose, so that they can perform during training at their best without being concerned over one additional thing hindering their performance.</p>
<p><button><a href="#">Supporting research</a></button></p>

<div>
<h2>Decreased maintenance costs for expensive vehicle filtration systems</h2>
<p>One of the largest cost expenditures in vehicle design is their air filtration systems. With reasonable routing alterations on navigation, beyond speed or distance, the moments between filter changes can be extended. (claim suspected, unverified)</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In February 2019 Microsoft and Fraunhofer organized an AI4Earth hackathon that brought together people from all over that were seeking to affect positive change for society and environment. This group over crazy individuals developed this idea and won the largest support grant that Microsoft offers through the AI4Earth program. We have stuck together on this solution since this time and have made significant progress as a team and individuals learning about the relationships between health, technology, and air quality.</p>
